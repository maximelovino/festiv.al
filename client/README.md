# Festiv.al - Client component
## How to run it?

To run the web server for the client, you have to install the dependencies first by doing:

```
npm install
```

Then you can run the web server using nodemon by using our start script:

```
npm start
```

Or if you have the `forever` module on your machine, you can run it by using:

```
forever start start.js
```

The web server will listen on port 80.
